## Features

This site was created from a design specification and colour scheme provided by https://skillcrush.com/

Flexbox is used extensively throughout the website to allow for a responsive layout.

## Installation

No special software or configurations are needed to view this project.

## Build Status

The Unplugged Retreat is a fictional retreat, so the contact details and map are mockup contact details, and the social media links are generic links to social media sites. There is no itinerary available to download when the "Download itinerary" button is clicked on the homepage.

It is intended that the lorem ipsum text will be replaced with real text.

## Tests

This site has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari, using a variety of screen widths.

The HTML was tested at https://validator.w3.org/
The CSS was tested at https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

All links were tested to ensure correct functionality.
